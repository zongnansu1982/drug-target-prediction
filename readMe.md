# Deep Mining Heterogeneous Networks to Predict Novel Drug-Target Associations
# Objective:   
We propose a similarity-based drug-target prediction method that enhances existing association discovery methods by using a topology-based similarity measure. 

# Methods:
1. NetWork: Linked Tripartite Network (LTN)
2. Similarity measure: DeepWalk
3. Inference method: DBSI, TBSI

# Usage   
1. Generate deepwalk index with DeepWalkMethod.java
2. Predict with Prediction.java
3. For nodes that are not listed in the network (new drugs or targets), use the similarity measures in chemicstrc and genomicsqs
